# Description
You play as a glitch in a poorly coded game. After time, everything inside the game begins to breakdown. The world is literally breaking down around the player. It is up to the player to fix the code from within the game.

Aside from making a game as part of the 48 hour Global Game Jam 2016, our small team wanted to make a game using Unity with no prior knowledge of the game engine.
